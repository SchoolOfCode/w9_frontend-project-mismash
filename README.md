## App Background
In week 9 of our School of Code bootcamp, we were challenged to come up with an app to help improve the remote learning experience of our fellow bootcampers in one short week.

As a team, we brainstormed around this theme and identified existing problems we could solve with an app. We ultimately decided to create an app that helps bootcampers socialise with each other and create events outside hours more easily.

## App Summary
'{SoC}ial' is a web app that allows the bootcampers to create and post online events within the School of Code community, as well as launching the events created by the other bootcampers. 

## Lessons learned
Skills we learned: 
* Agile methodologies
* Project planning & management 
* UX, UI design processes
* Working in a larger dev team (instead of working just in pairs)

We managed to product an app that fulfills our original brief. We created a team that help. We have created a team manifesto that helped us to stay on track and drive the group forward during decision making phases.
We realised how important it was to plan out each step and make sure everyone is on the same page at all times.
We feel we created an environment where everyone felt valued and that they contributed.
We learned the importance of having a realistic MVP in place and we think we came up with a very achievable design.
And overall, we are very happy that we got to work with each other and be involved with all aspects of the project.
Thanks for your time and I will now open up the floor for questions
